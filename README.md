4. You have to do this one dataset at a time. First select 2015 ACS 1-year Estimates. Click next.

5. Select a geographic type. We'll go with states. Click next.

7. It'll create a zip file with 25 items.

8. Save this in the Zip-File-Download directory. Add an underscore and the year to the zip file name.

9. You have to do this for as many years as you want data. They have ACS 1-yr estimates from 2007 - 2015. If you get all the datasets, it takes about 40 minutes of futzing on your computer to get it done.

If you want a different geographic boundary, I'm sorry, you'll have to modify the code yourself.
